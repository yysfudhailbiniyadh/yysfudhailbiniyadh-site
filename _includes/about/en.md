# ABOUT ME
Haiii :D My name's Hoshizora Chi. I got the Hoshizora surname from my girlfriend - Hoshizora Yuzu. I'm a student in two different universities in Indonesia, majoring in both translation linguistics and computer science. I'm also the chief editor and director of [the UsWorks magazine](https://majalah-usworks.org). With this blog, my mission is to spread beautiful messages from around the world. Or in a less-romanticized way to put it, I mostly translate lyrics and other fiction works from Japanese, Indonesian, and English. Maybe some Arabic too.

# ABOUT THIS WEBSITE

Huge respect and many thanks to him! Check [his blog here](https://hynduf.github.io/2023/12/31/building-my-aesthetic-personal-site/) on how he made the site.
